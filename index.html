        <h2>Life of a depressed superstar</h2>

        <h3>Early Life</h3>
        <p>Chester Bennington was born to Lee Russell Bennington on March 20th, 1976.
            He developed an interest in music at an early age. 
        He was greatly inspired by the bands, Stone Temple Pilots and Depeche Mode. <br><br>
        Chester's bad days took over when he turned seven years old.
        An older male friend of his used to touch him inappropriately and this molestation
        became a full-blown violent sexual assault.
        At age 11, his parents split which further scarred Chester. He began 
        to remain quiet and his behavior changed drastically after his parents' divorce. <br><br>
        Chester was also bullied at school for looking different and being skinny. 
        He used to stay alone and han no friends during his tenure at the school.
        
        Young Chester, depressed and alone, found his peace in music and started to 
        take music more seriously. He found his niche where he could be more recognized 
        as someone other than a bullied and sad child.

        <h3>Drug Addiction and Alcoholism</h3>
        <p>
            Chester Bennington struggled with drug addiction and alcoholism from a very young age.
            He started doing drugs like meth, marijuana, cocaine, and LSD when he was 13-years old.
            <br><br> Susan found out in no time that her son was on hard drugs.
            She worried about Chesters physical and mental health.
            Therefore, she curfewed 17-year-old Chester from going out.
            Chester started working at burger king to make a living.

            <blockquote>"I was on 11 hits of acid a day. I dropped so much acid I'm surprised I can still
                speak! [...] <br> I used pot to get off drugs. Every time I'd get a craving I'd smoke my pot.""
                <br>  -Chester Bennington, in a Kerrang interview [2016]
            </blockquote>

        <h3>Musical Career</h3>
        <p>
            Chester's musical career began in 1993 with his friend, Sean Dowell.
            Later in 1993, Chester got an opportunity to become the lead vocalist of the band “Grey Daze”.
            He performed for five years for the band until 1998, when he left the band.
            <br><br> In 1998, Chester met the vice president of Zomba Music, Jeff Blue.
            Jeff recognized Chester's work and asked him to audition for a boy band named
            Xero (later called Linkin Park).Chester cleared the audition and was liked by
            other members. He moved to Los Angeles in 1999 to work with Xero.

        <h3>The making of Linkin Park</h3>
        <p>
            Chester suggested the band change its name to Lincoln Park.
            However, the domain was already occupied, so the band was finally named 'Linkin Park',
            as we know of it today.
            <br><br> They released amazing award winning metal tracks.
            Songs like Numb, In the end, Meteora, Minutes to Midnight, A Thousand Suns,
            and One More Light are chartbuster tracks of Linkin Park.
            Chester often told in interviews that his music was closely related to his personal life.
            <br><br> Linkin Park bagged two Grammy awards, two Billboard Music Awards, six American Music Awards,
            and four MTV Video Music Awards. Linkin Park became famous as the sixth greatest band of
            the music era.

            <br><br> They married in the same year. Samantha gave birth to Bennington's son, Draven Sebastian Bennington.
            However, the marriage did not last. The couple broke up in 2005 due to increasing
            tension between both. <br><br> A few years later, Bennington married Talinda Ann Bentley, a

        <h3>Suicide</h3>
        <p>
            On May 18th, 2017, Chester's closest friend Chris Cornell was found dead in his Detroit apartment.
            Cornell suffered from depression and committed suicide by hanging himself.
            Cornell's death took a toll on Chester's mental health. He could not make peace with
            his closest friend's demise.
            <br><br> Chester commented on Cornell's death,
            <blockquote>“I can't imagine a world without you in it. I pray you to find peace in the next life.”</blockquote>
            <p>Almost a month after his friend's tragic death, Chester decided to end his life as well.
            Chester could not take the mental pressure anymore.
            <br><br> On July 20th 2017, Chester Bennington took his life by hanging himself in his house in
            California, leaving behind six children and wife Talinda.
        </p></p>

        <p id="sep">.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</p>
        
        <br>
        <p>Chester lived a tough life. He dealt with his demons for long enough until he could not
        take it any longer. However, Chester remains a legendary metal musician who made songs that
        touched our souls.
        His death serves as a morbid mental health reminder. No matter how strong one looks on the
        outside, they might be fighting a wretched battle inside.
